       <p><strong>Tekken</strong> is a popular fighting game series developed and published by Namco.The first entry in the Tekken series was originally released for arcades in 1994, and ported to the playStation the following year.</p>
       <p>The gameplay allows players to control each of the fighter's four limbs independently. The series later introduced combos and special moves, with characters also able to stage break arenas.</p>
       <p>The original arcade version features eight playable fighters. Each has a special "sub-boss" associated with them, who will be fought in Stage 8, followed by the final boss, Heihachi Mishima.</p>
       <p>The first entry in the Tekken series was followed by a sequel, Tekken 2, released in 1995. The latest entry in the series is Tekken 8, which introduces an all-new game mechanic called the ”Heat System,” giving players the ability to harness aggressiveness as their weapon, and incorporate these new offensive tactics into their playstyle.</p>
